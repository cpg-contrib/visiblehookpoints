Visible Hookpoints for Coppermine 1.6.x

Tool for plugin developers to locate plugin entry points (plugin hooks) and
array information.

Do not enable this plugin unless you want to start developing your own plugin.

Plugin comes with a configuration page (accessible via the config manager)
that will allow you to specify if the hookpoints should be displayed only if
the parameter "hookpoints" is set in the URL or if they are supposed to be
display always to every visitor. Second option is only meant for plugin
development on testbeds - do not use on production sites, as this plugin will
output information about the hookpoints directly on all pages.
